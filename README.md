[HalluciNet-ing Spatiotemporal Representations Using 2D-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04430)

Here, we have used VGG-bn-11 and [ResNeXt3d-101](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch) as our 2D-CNN student and 3D-CNN teacher, respectively. You may experiment with any other student-teacher combination.
